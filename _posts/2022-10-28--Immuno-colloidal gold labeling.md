## 实验步骤

For immunostaining the sections, a grid is incubated in solutions by floating section side down on a drop of solution and transferred sequentially from drop to drop to complete the immunostaining. To cover a grid, 5–50 μL drops of solution are placed on a piece of Parafilm in a Petri dish kept in a moist chamber to avoid drying of the solution. The section must never dry out during the procedure.

1.	Rinse the samples on drops of PBS for 3 times.<br>
2.	Block the samples on drops of 2% BSA（prepared in 1*PBS, pH 7.4）for 10min.<br>
3.	Incubate with first antibody(1:100) over night at 4℃.<br>
4.	Rinse with PBST for 5 *1min.<br>
5.	Incubate with second antibody( conjugated with colloidal gold) at room tempreture for 30min-60min.<br>
6.	PBST rinse for 5*1min.<br>
7.	Fix by 2.5% GA for 5min at room temperature.<br>
8.	Rinse on 3 drops of ddH2O. Then dry at room tempreture. <br>


如果标记效率较差，在封闭之前，可选做抗原修复步骤。<br>
抗原修复液可试选其一： 50mM Tris-Hcl (pH 8.2),  0.01M EDTA (pH 7.2) or 0.01 M citric acid (pH 6.0)<br>
将样品放到不同的修复液中(任选其一)， 65 ℃ 24h, 或90℃ 15-40min。修复液处理后，继续做后边的封闭和免疫。<br>
